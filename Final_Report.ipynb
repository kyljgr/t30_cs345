    "Our first step was to proccess the data and try to understand which parts of the data we wanted to use. Originally we were looking at the entire set of data which includes 18 different European countries during a 10 year period of time. Each city was observed during this time and the measurements of cloud cover, wind direction, wind speed, wind gust, humidity, sea level pressure, global radiation, precipitation amount, sunshine, and mean, max, and min temperatures were recorded. Just looking at the overall dataset we immediately decided that the 12 different measurements for 18 different places during the 10 year period would be too much for us to focus on and get accurate results. We decided to narrow down our search to a specific section of the data, just one country in Europe. In order to figure out which section we wanted to focus on we had to first find locations that had all the measurements. Through a search of the data we found that Germany had 3 locations in the dataset, Dresden, Kassel, and Dusseldorf that all had enough measurements to focus on. We then decided that it would be more beneficial to focus specifically on temperature, instead of trying to predict all the other aspects of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our dataset that we will be focusing on in this report is the Germany cities of Dresden, Kassel, and Dusseldorf, and their mean, max, and min temperatures throughout the 10 years.  \n",
